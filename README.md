# Word_Puzzle_Solver
The Word Puzzle Solver takes a grid of letters and a dictionary of valid words as input. It then systematically searches for all possible words that can be formed by moving in eight possible directions. By leveraging advanced data structures, the solver efficiently processes large grids and extensive word lists, ensuring high performance.
